I am a Doctoral Student at KU Leuvenâ€™s Faculty of Economics and Business (the Department of Management, Strategy and Innovation), specializing in innovation networks, knowledge transfer, and the economics of science. 

With a decade of experience spanning consulting, research, and teaching, my work bridges academia and industry by leveraging advanced big data analytics and social network analysis. Currently I am investigating how interpersonal ties between inventors and authors shape innovation, knowledge exchange, and collaboration in different industries.
